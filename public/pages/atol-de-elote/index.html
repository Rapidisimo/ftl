<p>Atol de Elote is a traditional drink of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica">Mesoamerican</a> origin. It is served hot and it warms the soul. The atole is easy to make although it takes a little bit of time and patience. In the end though, you’ll have made something so delicious and well worth the effort!</p>
<p>The original Mesoamerican recipe calls for young white corn on the husk. It can be difficult to find that type of corn, so instead, I opted to make my recipe with organic yellow corn, which is much easier to find. The traditional recipe also doesn’t use cornstarch but I found that by adding a few tablespoons in, it gives the atole a richer consistency, which makes it tastes better.</p>
<p>I’ve written down the ingredient list along with each step below. However, if you prefer to watch a video of the preparation instead, then please visit my <a href="https://youtube.com/foodtechlife">YouTube Channel</a>. I hope you enjoy it and let me know if you make it!</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blender</li>
<li>Nut Milk Bag or Thin White Kitchen Towel</li>
<li>Pot</li>
<li>Bowl</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 Cups Organic Whole Milk</li>
<li>568 grams Organic Yellow Corn</li>
<li>2 Sticks Cinnamon</li>
<li>4.5 Tbsp. Sugar – (Result is not too sweet. Adjust to your liking.)</li>
<li>1 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt – (This salt is not that salty, use less with other salts.)</li>
<li>5 Tbsp. Organic Cornstarch – (Thickening ingredient)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Add to a Blender</h3>
<ol>
<li>1.5 cups of milk</li>
<li>568 grams of organic corn</li>
<li>Blend thoroughly</li>
</ol>
<h3>Corn Liquid/Milk</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pour the blended corn into a nut milk bag and close it. If you are using a thin white kitchen towel instead, place it over a bowl first and then pour the liquid into the towel while its edges are still outside the bowl. Wrap the towel into a sort of knot at the top.</li>
<li>Squeeze out every last bit of liquid. This can take a few minutes.</li>
<li>Once you are done, you will be left with just the dry part of the corn. Set the liquid aside.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Simmer Milk</h3>
<ol>
<li>To a large pot, add 3 cups of milk and cook at a medium high heat.</li>
<li>Add two cinnamon sticks to the milk.</li>
<li>While the milk is warming up, prepare the cornstarch mixture in a separate container by using the remaining 1/2 cup of milk and 5 tablespoons of cornstarch.</li>
<li>Mix very well to avoid having clumps form when you add it to the hot milk. Put aside for now.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
<ol>
<li>Keep stirring the milk consistently.</li>
<li>Add the corn milk liquid immediately after the milk starts to simmer.</li>
<li>Keep stirring and add 4.5 tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt (or 1 tsp of Diamond Kosher salt).</li>
<li>Keep stirring and add the cornstarch milk mixture previously prepared. You'll notice that the Atol starts to have a thicker consistency.</li>
<li>Keep stirring constantly until the Atol comes to a gentle simmer.</li>
<li>Serve immediately and sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon powder if you like. Be careful sipping it!</li>
</ol>
