title: Arepa de Choclo (with whole corn)
---

I really enjoy making this arepa de choclo recipe because it’s easy to prepare and can serve as a vessel for other toppings. I hadn’t heard of arepas until a couple of years back when I started discovering Colombian food.

I’ve tried various arepa recipes but none lived up to my expectations. After doing some research, I came across one that I could build upon. Now that I’ve made it many times, while adjusting ratios, I’m confident you will enjoy this delicious recipe.
