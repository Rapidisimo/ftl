## My favorite quick and easy recipe

This really is an easy to make and very tasty Red Wine Sangria. I’ve had people tell me they don’t enjoy Sangria as much but after they had this one they were surprised at how good it tasted. My favorite part is how easy it is to drink. There is no harsh alcohol taste at all. If you make it let me know here or on YouTube. Cheers!

### Liquids

- 750 ml Red Wine (Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo or any red - wine you enjoy that is a bit fruity.)
