## Ingredients
- **1 cup long-grain white rice (200g)**
- **1 small tomato (80g), diced**
- **1/4 small onion (27g), diced**
- **1/4 green bell pepper (26g), diced**
- **1 tsp Better Than Bouillon (or half a bouillon cube)**
- **1/4 tsp adobo seasoning**
- **1 tsp kosher salt (adjust to taste)**
- **1 tsp olive oil (4g)**
- **8g butter**
- **1.5 cups water (341g)**

## Instructions
### Step 1: Rinse the Rice
Although not necessary, I always rinse my rice. It removes excess starch and helps achieve a fluffier texture. If you rinse it, remember that some enriched rice brands add powdered vitamins, which you might wash away.

1. **Place the rice in a shallow container.**
2. **Add enough water to cover it and gently scrub the grains.**
3. **Drain and repeat once more.**
4. **Let it sit in a strainer to remove excess water while preparing the other ingredients.**

### Step 2: Prepare the Ingredients

- **Dice the tomato, onion, and green pepper into small pieces.**
- **Measure out the seasonings, butter, and oil.**

### Step 3: Saut√© the Ingredients
1. **Heat a pot over medium heat.**
2. **Add olive oil and butter, letting the butter melt completely.**
3. **Stir in the diced tomato, onion, and green pepper.**
4. **Add salt, adobo, and Better Than Bouillon, mixing well.**

### Step 4: Fry the Rice
1. **Add the rinsed and drained rice to the pot.**
2. **Stir well to coat the rice with the oil and seasonings.**
3. **Let it toast lightly while stirring occasionally. This step enhances the flavor.**

### Step 5: Cook the Rice
1. **Once the rice is lightly fried and what remains of the tomato is just the peel, pour in 1.5 cups of water.**
2. **Scrape the bottom of the pot to lift any browned bits (adds extra flavor!).**
3. **Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for about 8 minutes, until most of the water evaporates.**
4. **Once you hear a light sizzle, reduce the heat to very low.**
5. **Mound the rice slightly in the center (this helps even cooking) and cover the pot.**
6. **Let it steam for 9.5 minutes, then turn off the heat.**

### Step 6: Fluff and Serve
1. **Uncover the pot and check the texture. The rice should be fluffy and separate easily.**
2. **Remove from the heat and let it rest uncovered for a few minutes to release excess steam.**
3. **Serve warm and enjoy!**

## Serving Suggestions
This arroz frito is delicious on its own, but it pairs wonderfully with:
- **Black bean soup** (I made some with boneless short ribs, and it was perfect for chilly days!)
- **Grilled meats or roasted vegetables**
- **A side of fried eggs for a simple, comforting meal**
