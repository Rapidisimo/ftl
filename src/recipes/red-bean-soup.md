After making bean soup many times I’ve arrived at this particular method of preparing them. I enjoy it because the flavor that comes out is rich and is quite the contrast if all your use to is canned beans.

When I have a bowl of red bean soup I add a little bit of cooked rice. For condiments I’ll have any of the following: ripe avocado, sour cream, hard cheese and tortillas. There’s times where I’ve all them of them and it becomes a hearty meal.
