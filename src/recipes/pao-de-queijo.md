## THE BEST GLUTEN FREE CHEESE BREAD YOU HAVENâ€™T TRIED IS HERE

The best thing about being curious or just living in an area where itâ€™s multicultural, is that you find out about a cheese bread that taste so good and is gluten free. Bonus. 

Now just because itâ€™s gluten free doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t watch how many of these you eat in a row. Let me know how it turns out!

Disclaimer: Iâ€™m still learning especially baking so my measurements may not be industry standard ðŸ™‚.

## Equipment 

- Oven
- Sauce Pan
- Bowl
- Scale
- Ramekin
- Grater

## Ingredients 

- 143 g Tapioca Flour
- 2.3 oz Olive Oil (or any other neutral tasting oil)
- 3 oz Milk (I use milk alternatives like almond)
- 1/2 Tsp Salt (I use kosher salt)
- 48 g Parmesan cheese (Aged cheese to grate or grated)
- 48 g Mozzarella cheese (Monterrey Jack or any other can work as well)
- 1 large egg

## Instructions 

1. Preheat oven to 400F or 204C
2. Place the tapioca flour in a mixing bowl.
3. Heat milk and oil in a sauce pan. Let simmer for a couple of seconds.
5. Add the hot milk/oil to the tapioca flour and mix well. Once done, set mixing bowl aside for 4 minutes or so while you prepare the other ingredients.
6. Whip the egg on a separate small container like a ramekin, put aside, then grate the cheeses.
7. Add all the ingredients back to the mixing bowl.
8. Mix vigorously â€“ the better you mix it and get a dough-like consistency the nicer the cheese bread will come out. This part can become difficult depending on the tool you use but it's worth it!
9. Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or use a silicone mat.
10. In case the dough is too sticky, you can use two spoons to grab and shape the dough into a small ball directly on the baking sheet. If the dough isn't too sticky, wet your hands a bit with water then shape the dough with your hands. Shape into a small ball of around 108g. This usually produces 4 small pieces of bread. 
11. Bake for 20-22 minutes on the mid or top rack until bread is lightly browned on top.
12. Once the bread is done, place the baking sheet on a cooling rack for a few minutes. Enjoy this delicious cheese bread warm!
